# Introduction to Metasploit

**Metasploit** is an automatic **exploitation framework**. The exploits inside are precompiled with **Ruby** and **already imported**. The whole framework is based on Ruby and works only with Ruby exploits. Anyone can create an `msf` **exploit**. Before using the exploit, a little configuration must be made. Exploits in **Metasploit** are based on **real vulnerabilities**. 

In addition to exploits, **Metasploit** has predefined payloads and auxiliary modules for post-exploitation or scanning. However, it is loud, so avoid it if the goal of the engagement is to stay stealthy.
