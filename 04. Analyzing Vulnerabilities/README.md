# Analyzing Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities are, at their core, poorly written code. The better you are with coding, the more you can understand everything. Vulnerabilities are a core concept in cyber security. On one hand, they must be mitigated/patched, and on the other, they must be exploited. Vulnerabilities can arise from literally everywhere! Never think, "There is no way that will work." Guess what, it is a way! Try it out!

## Path traversal

Path traversal is also known as directory traversal. These vulnerabilities enable an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application. This might include:

- Application code and data.
- Credentials for back-end systems.
- Sensitive operating system files.

In some cases, an attacker might be able to write to arbitrary files on the server, allowing them to modify application data or behavior and ultimately take complete control of the server.

Example:

```URL
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd
```

This causes the application to read from the following file path: 

```bash
/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd
```

This is a standard file on Unix-based operating systems containing details of the server's registered users. Still, an attacker could retrieve other arbitrary files using the same technique.


## Access Control

Access control applies constraints on who or what is authorized to perform actions or access resources. In the context of web applications, access control is dependent on authentication and session management:

- **Authentication** confirms that the user is who they say they are.
- **Session management** identifies which user makes subsequent HTTP requests.
- **Access control** determines whether the user can perform the action they are attempting to perform.

Broken access controls are common and often present a critical security vulnerability. Design and management of access controls are complex and dynamic problems that apply business, organizational, and legal constraints to a technical implementation. Access control design decisions have to be made by humans, so the potential for errors is high.
