## Information Gathering

**Reconnaissance** utilizes **creativity** and **technical** knowledge to **obtain sensitive**, **personal**, or **publicly** available **information** about a targeted asset. It is the first step in actual engagements and operations. **Reconnaissance** is the most essential part of security assessments, known as penetration testing / red teaming operations. A deep understanding of the target leads to finding and exploiting vulnerabilities.

### Passive

**Passive reconnaissance** obtains information about the target using **OSINT (Open Source INTelligence)**. **OSINT** is a set of techniques and tools for stealthily obtaining information about a target. **Passive reconnaissance** does not generate traffic to the target side.
