# Finding Vulnerabilities

**Finding Vulnerabilities** is an art. Here, we must combine and weaponize all the detailed information from previous steps. Seek for something unusual that can be abused or something of order. Examples: an **old version**, **missing field sanitization**, **missing HTTPS**, and many others. This can be done by fuzzing (poking the application with specific "malicious" payloads). 

To find a vulnerability, you must be aware of what vulnerability is and what types of vulnerabilities are there. It would help if you knew what you were trying to find. This means you must create and implement a methodology. Every pentester has his unique methods or way of doing things. Example methodology from hack tricks: [Pentesting Web Methodology](https://hacktricks.boitatech.com.br/pentesting/pentesting-web).

Do not look at finding vulnerabilities like a linear process. It is not going through an extensive checklist. Instead, be as creative as possible and perform illogical and logical things. Force the application to behave unexpectedly, research, and find the bug.
