# Linux Fundamentals

Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, first released by Linus Torvalds on September 17, 1991. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project.
