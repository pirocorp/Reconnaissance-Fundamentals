# Passive Reconnaissance

**Passive Reconnaissance** is the art of gathering information about a target without them even realizing it. It is also called **OSINT(Open Source Intelligence)** since it relies on open sources for the whole process. **Open sources** are **not** used in the context of **coding** **but** instead viewed as publicly **accessible resources**, which, by itself, can include code repositories.

**Passive Reconnaissance** is usually the very **first step** of actual engagements and operations. It is used for building up target context (domains, DNS map, live hosts, whois records, publicly available files, code, and more). **Passive Reconnaissance** requires thinking outside the box. It is **incredibly safe** since if done right, the **target is unaware**.
