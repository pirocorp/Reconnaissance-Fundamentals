# File System

The Linux file system is structured in a tree-like hierarchy and is documented in the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)](https://www.pathname.com/fhs/).

## File System Hierarchy

Linux is structured with the following standard top-level directories:

| Path   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /      | The top-level directory is the root filesystem. It contains all of the files required to boot the operating system before other filesystems are mounted and the files required to boot the other filesystems. After boot, all other filesystems are mounted at standard mount points as root subdirectories. |
| /bin   | Contains essential command binaries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| /boot  | Consists of the static bootloader, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
